You will no longer be able to access IEX Exchange market data through this API. Please see [SR-IEX-2021-13](https://storage.googleapis.com/assets-bucket/exchange/assets/SR-IEX-2021-13.pdf) or [IEX Trading Alert #2021 - 039](https://iextrading.com/alerts/#/171) for more information. IEX Exchange market data will continue to be available via the TOPS and DEEP feeds, as well as through commercial vendors such as [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/), which is operated separately from IEX Exchange. If you have any questions, please reach out to [api@iextrading.com](mailto:api@iextrading.com?subject=API%20Deprecation)</a>.
